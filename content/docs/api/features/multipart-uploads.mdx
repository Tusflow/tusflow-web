## Upload Process

### 1. Initialize Multipart Upload

```http
POST /files
Host: your-api.example.com
Tus-Resumable: 1.0.0
Upload-Length: 524288000
Upload-Metadata: filename d29ya2Zsb3cuanBn
X-Storage-Type: s3
```

Response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://your-api.example.com/files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216
Upload-Id: 2~zYYynl91c0L.Dt1387r4d.fhx9K
```

### 2. Upload Parts

Each part must be at least 5MB (except the last part).

```http
PATCH /files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216
Host: your-api.example.com
Tus-Resumable: 1.0.0
Upload-Offset: 0
Content-Length: 5242880
Upload-Part-Number: 1
Upload-Id: 2~zYYynl91c0L.Dt1387r4d.fhx9K
```

### 3. Complete Upload

After all parts are uploaded:

```http
POST /files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216/complete
Host: your-api.example.com
Tus-Resumable: 1.0.0
Upload-Id: 2~zYYynl91c0L.Dt1387r4d.fhx9K
```

## S3 Configuration

Required S3 settings:

- Bucket name
- Region
- Access credentials
- Optional: Custom endpoint for S3-compatible storage

## Best Practices

1. Use parallel uploads for better performance
2. Implement retry logic for failed parts
3. Verify ETags for uploaded parts
4. Clean up incomplete multipart uploads
