## Overview

Tusflow utilizes a powerful combination of Upstash Redis, AWS S3 multipart uploads, and the TUS protocol to provide a robust and efficient resumable upload solution.

<Callout type="info">
  Resumable uploads allow clients to pause and resume file uploads, making the process more resilient to network issues and providing a better user experience.
</Callout>

## Key Components

<Steps>
  ### Upstash Redis
  A serverless Redis database used for storing upload metadata and managing upload state.

  ### AWS S3 Multipart Uploads
  Enables large file uploads to be split into smaller parts, uploaded independently, and then reassembled.

  ### TUS Protocol
  An open protocol for resumable file uploads, ensuring consistency and interoperability.
</Steps>

## Features

### Upstash Redis Integration
- Serverless and globally distributed
- Low-latency access to upload metadata
- Automatic scaling and high availability

### AWS S3 Multipart Upload
- Support for large file uploads (up to 5TB)
- Parallel upload of file parts
- Ability to pause and resume uploads

### TUS Protocol Implementation
- Standardized resumable upload process
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Built-in error handling and recovery

## How It Works

<Callout type="warning">
  Understanding the upload process is crucial for optimizing your application's performance and reliability.
</Callout>

1. **Initiate Upload**
   - Client sends a POST request with file metadata
   - Server creates an entry in Upstash Redis and initiates S3 multipart upload

2. **Upload Chunks**
   - Client sends file chunks using PATCH requests
   - Server uploads parts to S3 and updates progress in Upstash Redis

3. **Resume Upload**
   - Client can retrieve upload offset using HEAD request
   - Server fetches current state from Upstash Redis

4. **Complete Upload**
   - After all chunks are uploaded, server completes S3 multipart upload
   - Upload metadata is cleaned up from Upstash Redis

## Best Practices

1. **Optimal Chunk Size**
   - Balance between network efficiency and memory usage
   - Typically between 5MB to 15MB per chunk

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Handle network disconnections gracefully

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Utilize Upstash Redis for real-time progress updates
   - Implement client-side progress bars for better UX
