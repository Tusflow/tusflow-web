## Overview

Tusflow implements smart chunk management to handle large file uploads efficiently and reliably.

<Callout type="info">
  The default chunk size is 5MB, but Tusflow automatically adjusts this based on network conditions and file characteristics.
</Callout>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  ### File Analysis
  When a file is selected for upload, Tusflow analyzes its size and type to determine the optimal chunking strategy.

  ### Chunk Creation
  The file is split into manageable chunks, with size determined by:
  - Network conditions
  - File size
  - Memory constraints
  - Client capabilities

  ### Parallel Processing
  Multiple chunks are uploaded simultaneously to maximize throughput while maintaining stability.

  ### Assembly
  Once all chunks are uploaded, they're automatically assembled in the correct order.
</Steps>


## Features

### Dynamic Sizing
Tusflow automatically adjusts chunk sizes based on:
- Upload speed
- Success rate
- Memory usage
- Network stability

### Parallel Processing
- Multiple chunks upload simultaneously
- Automatic concurrency management
- Progress tracking per chunk
- Bandwidth optimization

### Error Handling
- Automatic retries
- Partial upload recovery
- Checksum verification
- Progress preservation

## Best Practices

<Callout type="warning">
  While parallel uploads can improve speed, too many concurrent uploads can degrade performance. Start with 3-5 parallel uploads and adjust based on your needs.
</Callout>

1. **Chunk Size Selection**
   - Consider network conditions
   - Balance memory usage
   - Account for client capabilities

2. **Error Recovery**
   - Implement retry logic
   - Handle network failures
   - Maintain chunk integrity

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use parallel uploads
   - Implement caching
   - Monitor upload speeds

4. **Resource Management**
   - Clean up incomplete uploads
   - Monitor storage usage
   - Handle timeouts properly
