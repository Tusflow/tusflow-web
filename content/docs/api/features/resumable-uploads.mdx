## Starting an Upload

To initiate a resumable upload:

```http
POST /files
Host: your-api.example.com
Tus-Resumable: 1.0.0
Upload-Length: 100000000
Content-Type: application/offset+octet-stream
```

Response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://your-api.example.com/files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216
Tus-Resumable: 1.0.0
```

## Pausing an Upload

The upload can be paused at any time. The client should keep track of the upload URL and the number of bytes uploaded.

## Resuming an Upload

To resume an upload, send a HEAD request to get the current offset:

```http
HEAD /files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216
Host: your-api.example.com
Tus-Resumable: 1.0.0
```

Response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Upload-Offset: 50000000
Tus-Resumable: 1.0.0
```

Then continue uploading from the offset:

```http
PATCH /files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216
Host: your-api.example.com
Tus-Resumable: 1.0.0
Upload-Offset: 50000000
Content-Type: application/offset+octet-stream
Content-Length: 10000000

[BINARY DATA]
```

## Error Handling

If a connection is lost during upload:

1. Client can retrieve the last successful offset using HEAD request
2. Resume upload from that offset using PATCH request
3. No data needs to be re-uploaded
