## Overview

TusFlow runs on Cloudflare's global network of data centers, bringing file processing closer to your users for faster uploads and better reliability.

<Callout type="info">
  Files are processed at the edge, reducing latency and improving upload speeds by up to 30%.
</Callout>

## Key Benefits

<Steps>
  ### Global Distribution
  Your uploads are processed at the nearest edge location, reducing latency and improving speeds.

  ### Automatic Scaling
  The platform automatically scales based on demand, handling any number of concurrent uploads.

  ### Real-time Processing
  Process uploads in real-time at the edge without routing through a central server.
</Steps>

## Features

### Network Optimization
- Automatic routing optimization
- Connection multiplexing
- Protocol negotiation
- Smart retries

### Performance
- Sub-millisecond cold starts
- Automatic caching
- Memory optimization
- Concurrent processing

### Reliability
- Global redundancy
- Automatic failover
- DDoS protection
- Always-on availability



## Best Practices

<Callout type="warning">
  While edge computing provides significant benefits, it's important to optimize your uploads for edge processing to get the best performance.
</Callout>

1. **Chunk Size Optimization**
   - Use appropriate chunk sizes
   - Consider edge memory limits
   - Enable parallel processing

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache upload metadata
   - Use appropriate TTLs
   - Implement cache warming

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement graceful degradation
   - Use appropriate timeouts
   - Handle edge failures
