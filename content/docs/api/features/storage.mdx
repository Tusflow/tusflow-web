## Overview

Tusflow supports integration with any AWS S3-compatible storage service, including Cloudflare R2, Tigris, and others. This flexibility allows you to choose the best storage solution for your needs.

## Supported Storage Services

- **AWS S3**: The original and most widely used object storage service.
- **Cloudflare R2**: A cost-effective alternative with no egress fees.
- **Tigris**: A scalable and performant storage solution.
- **Other S3-Compatible Services**: Any service that supports the S3 API.

## Configuration

To connect Tusflow to your chosen storage service, configure the following environment variables in your `wrangler.toml` file:

```toml
[vars]
AWS_REGION = "your-region"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "your-access-key-id"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "your-secret-access-key"
AWS_ENDPOINT = "your-storage-endpoint"
AWS_BUCKET_NAME = "your-bucket-name"
```

### Example Configuration

#### AWS S3

```toml
[vars]
AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "your-aws-access-key-id"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "your-aws-secret-access-key"
AWS_ENDPOINT = "https://s3.amazonaws.com"
AWS_BUCKET_NAME = "your-s3-bucket-name"
```

#### Cloudflare R2

```toml
[vars]
AWS_REGION = "auto"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "your-r2-access-key-id"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "your-r2-secret-access-key"
AWS_ENDPOINT = "https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
AWS_BUCKET_NAME = "your-r2-bucket-name"
```

#### Tigris

```toml
[vars]
AWS_REGION = "your-region"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "your-tigris-access-key-id"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "your-tigris-secret-access-key"
AWS_ENDPOINT = "https://<account-id>.tigrisdata.com"
AWS_BUCKET_NAME = "your-tigris-bucket-name"
```

## Implementation Details

Tusflow uses the AWS SDK to interact with S3-compatible storage services. The following code snippet demonstrates how to initialize the S3 client:

```typescript
import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';

const s3Client = new S3Client({
    region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
    endpoint: process.env.AWS_ENDPOINT,
    credentials: {
        accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
        secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
    },
    forcePathStyle: true, // Required for some S3-compatible services
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Use IAM roles and policies to restrict access
   - Rotate access keys regularly
   - Use environment variables to store sensitive information

2. **Performance**
   - Choose the closest region to your users
   - Enable transfer acceleration if supported
   - Monitor storage usage and costs

3. **Reliability**
   - Enable versioning for data protection
   - Use lifecycle policies to manage data retention
   - Implement backup and disaster recovery plans
